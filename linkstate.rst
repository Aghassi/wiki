How To Hold a Link-State
========================

Link-State Committee
--------------------

**Chair of Speakers:** This person will handle the logistics and scheduling of
talks.  They will *not* be solely responsible for soliciting speakers -- this is
a duty that all HacSoc members should hare.

- They will hold the whip on getting members to invite speakers.
- They will evaluate talk proposals.
- They are the person who will finalize the schedule: determine time slots, do
  the logistics of putting speakers into slots, etc.

**Chair of Food:** This person organizes the food:

- Solicits suggestions from general body (and ideally provides some of their own
  suggestions).
- Conducts polls of the general body to guide their decision making.
- Ultimately, makes the final decision on who we will select to cater each meal.
- Places orders for all meals.
- Arranges pick-up for meals.

**Chair of Facilities:** This person is in charge of facilities for the
conference:

- Reserves all necessary rooms for the conference day.
- Makes any arrangements for parking and validation.
