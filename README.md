# Hacker's Society Wiki

### Contributing:

All non-sensitive information documentation is welcome here.  The goal of this
wiki is to document the things we have done, or are currently running.  Because
Hacker's Society is a student organization, the group will have entirely new
members approximately every four years.  To help prevent things from getting
lost in the transitions, this wiki was made.


### Compiling:

This wiki is made using `Sphinx` documentation.  To build the wiki, you must
first [install Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/).

After `Sphinx` has been installed,  issuing a `make html` will generate the HTML
seen at [http://hacsoc.org/wiki/](http://hacsoc.org/wiki/).

For syntax help, see [here](http://sphinx-doc.org/rest.html).  The syntax used
is ReStructured Text, not MarkDown.
