Hacker's Society Communication Streams
======================================

This is all about getting a set of written conventions for using our array of communications methods within the Hacker Society. More complex services may have their conventions broken out into another document so that this document can have a fairly flat structure.

It is best to assume that other services shouldn’t be used for official group communication, but this list of conventions does not serve as a whitelist for allowed communication services. Improving the productivity of using a service by changing the convention, or changing the service, is highly recommended.

Email
---------

- Old, somewhat clunky, and the most important of our communications.
- Contains several mailing lists:

    - `cwru-hackers mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/cwru-hackers>`_
    - `hackers-discuss mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/hackers-discuss>`_
    - `acm-downtime mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/subscribe/acm-downtime>`_
    - `hackers-summer mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/hackers-summer>`_
    - `acm-announce mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/hackers-summer>`_
    - `acm-exec mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-exec>`_
    - `acm-members mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-members>`_
    - `acm-officers mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-officers>`_
    - `acm-talk mailing list <https://lists.case.edu/wws/info/acm-talk>`_

- Has to move over to some Google hosted service before the end of 2015?
